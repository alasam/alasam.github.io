              Hello! Thanks for dropping by. My name is Anthony Lasam
            </p>
            <p className="sm:text-right py-2">
              I am a System Analyst with 8+ years of experience managing system
              and environments, as well as 1+ year as a Deployment Specialist
              reviewing and testing code in lower environments before deploying
              updates and patches to Production. With many years working in the
              Tech industry I have gained many skills, such as communication and
              customer service, problem solving, hardware and software
              familiarity, and recently gained coding knowledge, I believe my
              passion for coding and learning will be a great fit with any
              company that I have the privilage to work with.
